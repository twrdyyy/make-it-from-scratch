# Make it from scratch :fire:

Do you want to write popular machine learning and deep learning models from
scratch? :wink: This repository is perfect for you :ok_hand:

## Introduction :mortar_board:

Creating machine learning and deep learning models is not all about :broken_heart:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensroflow import keras
```

I do not deny that tensorflow is useless :open_mouth: (it's actually powerful) but have you ever wondered how it looks from the mathematical side :question:

## Requirements :mega:

-   Python 3.7+ :snake:
-   Numpy :computer:
-   Matplotlib :bar_chart:

```bash
pip3 install numpy matplotlib
```

Check if everything works properl :white_check_mark:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
