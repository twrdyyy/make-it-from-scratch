# Normalization

Sometimes our dataset has quite high **standard deviation**. It is hard for our machine to compute numbers from wide range also it is **error prone**.
We normalize all of our data that it its values are close to **[-1, 1]** interval.

In this implementation we substract the dataset by its mean and then divide by its standard deviation.
