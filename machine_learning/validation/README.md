# Validation

What do we always do with dataset we split it into

-   train dataset
-   test dataset

Now we split our dataset into

-   train dataset
-   test dataset
-   **validaton dataset**

It might sound hard but it's actually very easy thing. **Validation** dataset is used to evaluate a given model, but for frequent evaluation.
We use this data to fine-tune the model **hyperparameters**.
